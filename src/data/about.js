  description: `I'm a Senior iOS Developer with over 7 years of experience crafting high-performance 
mobile applications. I specialize in building scalable, user-centric iOS solutions 
that serve millions of users, with expertise in Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, and modern iOS architectures.

Currently at Paytm since January 2020, I've developed key features for Homepage, Search, 
and Storefront modules. Prior to that, I worked at Samsung Research Institute (2017-2020), 
building the Universal Guide Module for the Smart Things App.

I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and following iOS best practices. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new places and traveling.`,
